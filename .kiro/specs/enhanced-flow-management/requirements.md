# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Enhanced Flow Management System transforms the current basic flow editor into a comprehensive template-based flow management platform with role-based access control. The system introduces a hierarchical structure where administrators create templates, organize them into groups and sections, and build blueprints, while collaborators create scripts containing setups (blueprint instances) with flows (template instances) and fill them with data while maintaining structural integrity.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Template Management System

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to create and manage reusable workflow templates with predefined node structures and blocks, so that I can establish consistent patterns for collaborators to use.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator creates a template THEN the system SHALL store the template with nodes, blocks, edges, and optional default data
2. WHEN an administrator defines a template structure THEN the system SHALL validate that all required node types and block configurations are present
3. WHEN an administrator updates a template THEN the system SHALL preserve existing instances while allowing new instances to use the updated version
4. IF a template contains default data THEN the system SHALL apply this data to new template instances
5. WHEN an administrator deletes a template THEN the system SHALL prevent deletion if the template is referenced in any blueprint

### Requirement 2: Group Organization System

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to organize templates into groups with defined positioning, so that I can create logical collections of related templates for blueprint construction.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator creates a group THEN the system SHALL allow assignment of multiple templates with explicit position fields
2. WHEN an administrator assigns templates to a group THEN the system SHALL support many-to-many relationships where templates can belong to multiple groups with different positions
3. WHEN an administrator defines template positions within a group THEN the system SHALL store explicit position values for ordering
4. WHEN an administrator modifies group composition THEN the system SHALL update all blueprints that reference the group while preserving position relationships
5. IF a template is removed from a group THEN the system SHALL validate that no blueprints depend on that specific template-group relationship

### Requirement 3: Section Classification System

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to create sections that represent different activity types and assign groups to them, so that I can categorize workflow patterns by their educational or functional purpose.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator creates a section THEN the system SHALL allow assignment of multiple groups with many-to-many relationships
2. WHEN an administrator assigns groups to sections THEN the system SHALL maintain the relationships for blueprint creation
3. WHEN an administrator defines section properties THEN the system SHALL store metadata about the activity type and purpose
4. IF a section is deleted THEN the system SHALL prevent deletion if any blueprints reference the section
5. WHEN groups are assigned to sections THEN the system SHALL maintain the assignment relationships for blueprint creation

### Requirement 4: Blueprint Construction System

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to create blueprints that define structural compositions of templates from section groups, so that I can provide ready-to-use workflow structures for collaborators.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator creates a blueprint THEN the system SHALL require association with exactly one section
2. WHEN an administrator builds a blueprint structure THEN the system SHALL allow selection of templates from the section's assigned groups
3. WHEN an administrator includes templates in a blueprint THEN the system SHALL support template duplication and reuse within the same blueprint
4. WHEN an administrator defines blueprint composition THEN the system SHALL maintain group organization and template positioning
5. IF a blueprint references templates or groups THEN the system SHALL validate that all references exist and are accessible

### Requirement 5: Script Management System

**User Story:** As a collaborator, I want to create scripts that contain multiple sections, so that I can build complete projects with different activity types.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a collaborator creates a script THEN the system SHALL allow inclusion of multiple sections
2. WHEN a collaborator adds sections to a script THEN the system SHALL maintain section ordering through explicit position fields
3. WHEN a collaborator manages script structure THEN the system SHALL allow addition, removal, and reordering of sections
4. WHEN a collaborator modifies script sections THEN the system SHALL maintain section references in associated setups
5. WHEN a script is created THEN the system SHALL assign unique identifiers and track creation metadata

### Requirement 6: Setup Instance System

**User Story:** As a collaborator, I want to create setups as instances of blueprints that can be freely modified, so that I can customize workflow structures without affecting the original blueprint.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a collaborator selects a blueprint THEN the system SHALL create a setup as an independent snapshot
2. WHEN a setup is created THEN the system SHALL copy all blueprint structure including groups, templates, and positioning
3. WHEN a collaborator modifies a setup THEN the system SHALL allow reordering of groups and flows without affecting the original blueprint
4. WHEN a setup contains flows THEN the system SHALL maintain relationships between flows and their parent groups
5. IF a setup is modified THEN the system SHALL preserve all original blueprint references for audit purposes

### Requirement 7: Flow Instance System

**User Story:** As a collaborator, I want to create flows as instances of templates within setups, so that I can fill templates with specific data while maintaining the structural pattern.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a setup is created THEN the system SHALL automatically generate flows for each template reference in the blueprint
2. WHEN a flow is created THEN the system SHALL maintain references to the original template, parent setup, and group
3. WHEN a collaborator fills flow data THEN the system SHALL validate data against the template's block structure
4. WHEN flows are displayed THEN the system SHALL respect group ordering and positioning within the setup
5. IF a flow's template structure changes THEN the system SHALL preserve existing data while accommodating structural updates

### Requirement 8: Data Management and Validation

**User Story:** As a collaborator, I want to fill flows with specific data while maintaining structural integrity, so that I can create functional workflows that adhere to the template patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a collaborator enters flow data THEN the system SHALL validate data against the template's block schema
2. WHEN data is saved to a flow THEN the system SHALL preserve the template's node and block structure
3. WHEN invalid data is entered THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and prevent saving
4. IF a template has default data THEN the system SHALL pre-populate new flows with these defaults
5. WHEN data is modified THEN the system SHALL maintain data integrity across all related blocks and nodes

### Requirement 9: Structural Modification System

**User Story:** As a collaborator, I want to modify setup structures by reordering groups and flows, so that I can customize the workflow sequence to meet specific project needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a collaborator reorders groups within a setup THEN the system SHALL update explicit position fields to reflect new ordering
2. WHEN a collaborator reorders flows within a group THEN the system SHALL maintain group relationships while updating position values
3. WHEN a collaborator removes flows from a setup THEN the system SHALL remove the flows from the snapshot and update group flow references
4. WHEN structural changes are made THEN the system SHALL preserve all flow data and relationships while updating position fields
5. IF structural modifications conflict with template requirements THEN the system SHALL prevent the changes and provide guidance

### Requirement 10: Access Key-Based Permissions

**User Story:** As a user, I want to enter an access key to determine my role permissions, so that I can access the appropriate features without complex authentication systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters an administrator access key THEN the system SHALL provide access to template, group, section, and blueprint management
2. WHEN a user enters a collaborator access key THEN the system SHALL provide access to script, setup, and flow creation and editing
3. WHEN access permissions are enforced THEN the system SHALL prevent collaborators from modifying templates, groups, sections, or blueprints
4. WHEN access permissions are enforced THEN the system SHALL prevent administrators from accessing collaborator-specific scripts and setups
5. IF an invalid access key is entered THEN the system SHALL deny access and log the security event
6. WHEN a user access the system via the link include the access key, THEN the system SHALL automatically use that access key from URL
